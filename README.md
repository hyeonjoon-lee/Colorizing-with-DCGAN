# Colorizing-with-DCGAN
Pytorch implementation of "Image Colorization using Generative Adversarial Networks"

## Notes
- The code implementations are based on the paper _Image Colorization using Generative Adversarial Networks (Nazeri et al., 2018)_ and its official code implementation in tensorflow
- The PyTorch implementation of spectral normalization is from [Christian Cosgrove's repo](https://github.com/christiancosgrove/pytorch-spectral-normalization-gan).
